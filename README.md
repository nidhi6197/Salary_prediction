# Salary_prediction
# Define the Problem
### Project Goal: The goal of this project is to examine a set of job postings with salaries and then predict salaries for a new set of job postings.
Tool: Python 3-Jupyter Notebook with a wide range of libraries and packages such as Pandas,NumPy,sklearn,matplotlib,seaborn for data manipulation,data visualization and predictive modeling.
# Data
There are 3 different file under the data.zip  
<h4>train_features.csv</h4>-Each observation represents an individual's job posting; each column represents unqiue information about this applicant and the job applied to. This dataset is meant to be used in training models.

test_features.csv - Each observation represents an individual's job posting; each column represents unqiue information about this applicant and the job applied to. This dataset is meant to be used for evaluating models trained on train_features.csv.

train_salaries.csv - Each observation represents an individual's salary corresponding to their job posting in train_features.csv.

### Features:

jobId - the id of the job posting (unique)  
companyId - the id of the company posting the job (unique)  
jobType - the type of the job (e.g. CEO, CFO, senior, etc)  
degree - the highest degree obtained by the applicant (e.g. DOCTORAL, MASTERS, BACHELOR, etc)  
major - the major of this applicant in college (e.g. business, math, etc)

yearsExperience - years of experience required  
milesFromMetropolis - distance away from the metropolis in miles  
salary - the salary of the job posting
